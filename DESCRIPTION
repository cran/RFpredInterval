Description: Implements various prediction interval methods with random forests and boosted forests.
    The package has two main functions: pibf() produces prediction intervals with boosted forests
    (PIBF) as described in Alakus et al. (2021) <arXiv:2106.08217> and rfpi() builds 15 distinct
    variations of prediction intervals with random forests (RFPI) proposed by Roy and Larocque (2020)
